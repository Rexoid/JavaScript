For those that reading this i would like you to create some levels for me to test with.

the format for levels is in "Level_layout.json".

instructions for making levels:

the layout needs to be 400 charcter string, you can easly do this by making a 20x20 grid out of the numbers.
you can use "MS Paint" or "http://js.do/code/rexoidpixelart" to help you create you level.
the number codes for each block is in the "Level_Assets.json" file.
after the layout is done write the "active" value as false.
then name it anything you want(be creative) and send it to me using the format in "Level_layout.json" at jacob.ivory12@gmail.com

Thanks
